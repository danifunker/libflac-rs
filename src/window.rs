//! Apodization windows, ported from `window.c`. Only the windows the level-8
//! `subdivide_tukey(3)` apodization needs are implemented here — `tukey` (which
//! falls back to `rectangle`/`hann` at the parameter extremes); the full
//! apodization set is a later generalization milestone.
//!
//! All coefficients are `f32` (`FLAC__real`). The transcendental is `cosf`: the
//! argument is formed in `f64` (`M_PI * n / Np`, matching C's `double`-precision
//! `M_PI`) and narrowed to `f32` before the cosine, exactly as the C does. Built
//! and run under glibc so Rust's `f32::cos` resolves to the same libm `cosf`.
