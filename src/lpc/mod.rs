//! The LPC float pipeline (`lpc.c`): windowing → autocorrelation → Levinson →
//! quantization → residual. This is the F2 float-parity gate; every stage must
//! reproduce the C reference's exact float evaluation, so the code is a faithful
//! transcription rather than idiomatic Rust where bytes are at stake.
//!
//! `FLAC__real` is `f32`; the windowed signal is `f32`, autocorrelation and
//! Levinson accumulate in `f64`. See the module doc-comments for the specific
//! `*.c` lines and the bit-exactness hazards each stage carries.
